# frontend

This folder contains the frontend application (React + Vite). After running the restructure script, frontend resources will be moved here.

To run locally (from repo root):
1) cd frontend
2) npm install
3) npm run dev

Note: The `restructure_repo.ps1` script will move files into this directory when you run it. If you prefer manual moves, you can place `index.html`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, and the `src/` folder here.
